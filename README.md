# Mercari_Price_Sugesstion
This is all works and experiments that we did in the Mercari Price Suggession Challenge Competition. 
In the final, we ended up with a score of 0.42656289790588664 on the created test dataset. This dataset splitted from 10% of the Mercari's original train dataset. Hence our test dataset contain over 1 millions samples, which is much more than the test dataset in the Stage 1 of the Competiton (only about 700.000 samples)
So I belive that this result is fair enough compare to other team in Stage 1 of the competiton.

Our datasets were created and processed seperately and saving to the Drive for further usage. So here is link to our Drive, which contain all the data we created and all the model's checkpoints for the competition. 
Hope you enjoy our work here. :D
